# Information Visualization Redesign Project

## Project Overview

This project presents a critical analysis and redesign of data visualization using Amazon QuickSight and Google Colab. 
It focuses on improving the original filledmap visualization in terms of perceptual clarity, interactivity, and data transparency.

The project was completed for the course INFOSCI 301 at Duke Kunshan University, instructed by Professor Luyao Zhang.
