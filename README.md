# Information Visualization Redesign Project

## Project Overview

This project presents a critical analysis and redesign of data visualization using Amazon QuickSight and Google Colab. 
It focuses on improving the original filledmap visualization in terms of perceptual clarity, interactivity, and data transparency.

The project was completed for the course INFOSCI 301 at Duke Kunshan University, instructed by Professor Luyao Zhang.

## Contribution to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

This Information Visualization Redesign Project actively supports several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by advancing data accessibility, promoting environmental awareness, and fostering innovative visualization practices grounded in critical theory and practical application.

### Relevant SDGs:

- ![Goal 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Sustainable_Development_Goal_4.png)  
  **Goal 4: Quality Education**  
  Through critical engagement with visualization theory and practice, the project promotes higher standards of data literacy and empowers users to interact with complex environmental data more effectively.

- ![Goal 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Sustainable_Development_Goal_9.png)  
  **Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure**  
  By integrating hybrid visualization methods using Amazon QuickSight and Python, the project advances sustainable innovation and data infrastructure.

- ![Goal 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Sustainable_Development_Goal_13.png)  
  **Goal 13: Climate Action**  
  The redesigned visualization improves climate risk communication, fostering public understanding and informed action toward climate change mitigation.

In addition, by adhering to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles, this project contributes to strengthening global knowledge infrastructures, supporting open science, transparency, and equitable information access.

## Future Research Direction on Digital Humanities

Building on insights from the field trip to the Zhouzhuang Mystery of Life Museum, this project identifies several future research directions at the intersection of information visualization, digital humanities, and scientific storytelling.

The museum’s exhibits, featuring real human, terrestrial, and marine biological specimens, highlighted the power of tangible artifacts in communicating complex biological and ecological knowledge. Inspired by this, future visualization projects can explore how digital platforms — including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and interactive web environments — can replicate and enhance the educational impact of physical specimens.

Potential research directions include:

- **Digital Preservation and Visualization of Biological Specimens:** Creating high-fidelity 3D models of real-world specimens to expand access to rare biological resources and support global scientific literacy.

- **Immersive Storytelling for Biodiversity Education:** Developing AR/VR experiences that allow users to interact with biological data and narratives, bridging gaps between scientific information, aesthetic engagement, and ethical considerations.

- **Ethical Visualization in Digital Humanities:** Investigating best practices for digitally representing real biological entities, ensuring respect for life, scientific accuracy, and ethical storytelling in digital environments.

Reflecting on the museum’s integration of aesthetics, scientific precision, and ethical presentation, future projects can aim to create interactive visualizations that not only convey information but also evoke emotional and ethical awareness — essential qualities for advancing digital humanities and sustainable education initiatives.

A photograph from the field trip has been included in the deliverables to document the learning journey and inspire further exploration.
